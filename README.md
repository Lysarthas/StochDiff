An implementation of "[**Stochastic Diffusion: A Diffusion Based Model for Stochastic Time Series Forecasting**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711896.3737137)" (KDD '25).

# Instructions:

Jupyternote book *stochdiff* provides an instruction to run the model and make forecasting on the Cochlear patient data.

You can train the model with your own datasets with the *train.py*.

The codes are written in *pytorch 1.13*, please setup your environment correspondingly to run the model.

If you find this model useful and put it in your publication, we encourage you to add the following references:
